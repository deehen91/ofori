						<h5>Civil Litigation<br></h5><br>
						People have rights, and if these rights are violated by another person, it may be brought to court as a civil litigation. Unlike criminal law, if there is a dispute between two or more parties, civil litigation will seek to compensate the victim or have a specific action performed by the opposing party. Generally, civil litigation, or any civil case is a resolution to the breaking of private law issues regarding individuals, businesses, or non-profit organizations.<br>
						<br>
						<div class="feature">

These may include but not limited to employee disputes, breach of contract, debt collection, partnership disputes, and interference with business or contracts. It is very important to have an experienced litigation attorney to represent the client’s interest.

Tort law addresses and provides compensation for a civil wrong doing or negligence.<br>
								<br></p>
							</div><br>
							<h5>Negligence</h5><br>
							<br>
							A person is negligent if that person acts in a way opposed to that of an “ordinary reasonable person”. Depending on the situation, both parties could be considered liable, and that decision is determined by the court. This is why it is best to seek a professional personal injury attorney who would represent your interest.<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Personal Injury Attorney</h5><br>
							<br>
							A personal injury attorney will file legal complaints, argue cases in court, draft legal documents, and offer legal advice to clients.
